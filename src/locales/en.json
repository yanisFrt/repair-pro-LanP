      "q1": {
        "question": "Why a subscription and not a cheaper 'lifetime' license?",
        "answer": "A 'lifetime' license is often a trap: it's valid for a frozen version of the software. When faced with a bug, new technology, or a simple need for evolution, you're on your own. Our subscription is a partnership: it finances continuous improvement, responsive support, and the guarantee that your work tool will NEVER become obsolete. You're not buying a product, you're investing in your peace of mind and growth."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What happens if I have a technical problem?",
        "answer": "It's our greatest strength. With a lifetime license, support is often paid, slow, or non-existent. Our subscribers benefit from priority WhatsApp support with a guaranteed response in less than 2 hours. No more stress: an expert is always there to unblock you and let you focus on your customers."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Is my data secure?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Locally installed software is vulnerable to theft and computer failure. You risk losing everything. Our solution automatically and daily backs up your data on secure servers. It's the assurance that your most valuable asset — your customer and repair history — is always safe."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How do updates work?",
        "answer": "They're automatic, transparent, and included in your subscription. Every month, we deploy improvements, security fixes, and new features, often inspired by user feedback. Your software becomes more powerful over time, with no effort or additional cost on your part."
